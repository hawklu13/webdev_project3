    <h2>My Favorite Players</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Derrick Rose</strong><br>
        <p>Derrick Rose is my favorite basketball player of all time. He’s very flashy and fun to watch. 
        He always finds a way to get to the rim and lay up the ball. He’s very fast, and I love the fact that he is from Chicago. 
        He’s a hometown hero of sorts. I wish his career didn’t get cut short. He is Chicago’s MVP.</p>

      </li>

      <li><strong>Demar Derozan</strong><br>
        <p>Demar was traded to the Bulls in the 2021 season. He surprised everyone with how good of a scorer and how clutch he was. 
        He won us a lot of games with his clutch ability. He got traded not too long ago, but I am happy he played for us and hope 
        he thrives on his new team.</p>

        </div>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Matas Buzelis</strong><br>
        <p>Matas Buzelis is a rookie, just got drafted this past year. He is from the suburbs of Chicago, which I like. 
        He’s a great dunker and plays really good defense. Hope he can show us some more of his potential soon.</p>

    <p>This game was my favorite player's, Demar's, 1000th game. We got to be really close to the court and were astonished 
    by how beautiful the court looked. I had a great time and hope I can be back soon.</p>
